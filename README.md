# Welcome to Kaglet!
An app made by K students, for K students.


## Why? 
Socializing in COVID was hard. For all of us. Kaglet is helping K college students meet up again! 

## What?  
An event app! Find or post about events on and around campus. 

House Party? Get it started here!
Campus Event? Ask people to join!
Study Session? Someone probably wants to join! 

### How?

Just login using your K email, sign in using the link and you're in! Post or view about events, and RSVP if you're interested. You probably should RSVP, it's definitely worth it. 

## What next? 

We will keep rolling out updates with new features. Leave us a feedback at `email`! Keep checking kaglet.app for more.
